# Spotify’s KPI and Experimentation

## User Journey

I’ve been using Spotify for 4 years, and it has become an integral part of my daily life. As a music enthusiast, I rely on Spotify for discovering new music, creating playlists, and enjoying personalized recommendations. Over time, I’ve noticed areas where Spotify could improve to enhance user engagement and loyalty. Below, I propose three experiments to test potential improvements to the Spotify experience.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Personalized Playlist Covers
**Objective**: Test whether allowing users to customize playlist covers (e.g., adding photos, themes, or artwork) increases playlist creation and engagement.

**Hypotheses**:
- **Null Hypothesis**: Allowing users to customize playlist covers does not increase playlist creation or engagement.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: Users who can customize playlist covers will create more playlists and engage with them more frequently.

**Metrics**:
- **Leading Metric**: Number of playlists created per user.
- **Lagging Metric**: Average time spent listening to user-created playlists.

**Test Cell Allocation**:
- **Control Group (50%)**: Users cannot customize playlist covers (default Spotify behavior).
- **Test Group (50%)**: Users can customize playlist covers with photos, themes, or artwork.

### Experiment 2: Mood-Based Music Recommendations
**Objective**: Test whether adding a "Mood Selector" feature (e.g., Happy, Sad, Energetic, Relaxed) to the home screen improves user engagement and satisfaction with music recommendations.

**Hypotheses**:
- **Null Hypothesis**: Adding a mood selector does not improve user engagement or satisfaction with music recommendations.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: Users who can select their mood will spend more time listening to music and rate recommendations more positively.

**Metrics**:
- **Leading Metric**: Number of times the mood selector is used per user.
- **Lagging Metric**: Average session length and user satisfaction scores (via survey).

**Test Cell Allocation**:
- **Control Group (50%)**: Users see the standard home screen without a mood selector.
- **Test Group (50%)**: Users see a home screen with a mood selector that tailors recommendations based on their selected mood.

### Experiment 3: Collaborative Listening Rooms
**Objective**: Test whether introducing "Collaborative Listening Rooms" (where users can listen to music simultaneously with friends and chat in real-time) increases social engagement and time spent on the platform.

**Hypotheses**:
- **Null Hypothesis**: Collaborative Listening Rooms do not increase social engagement or time spent on the platform.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: Users who participate in Collaborative Listening Rooms will spend more time on Spotify and invite more friends to join.

**Metrics**:
- **Leading Metric**: Number of Collaborative Listening Rooms created and joined.
- **Lagging Metric**: Average time spent in listening rooms and number of friends invited to Spotify.

**Test Cell Allocation**:
- **Control Group (50%)**: Users do not have access to Collaborative Listening Rooms.
- **Test Group (50%)**: Users can create and join Collaborative Listening Rooms.

## Conclusion

These experiments aim to enhance Spotify’s user experience by introducing new features that encourage personalization, mood-based discovery, and social interaction. By testing these ideas, Spotify can identify innovative ways to retain users and stay ahead of competitors like YouTube Music.
